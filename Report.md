# OBJECTIVE

<p> The project's method involves thoroughly exploring datasets linked to heart disease, cancer, and
diabetes. By using advanced analysis techniques, it aims to deeply understand the characteristics
and distributions of important variables within each dataset using tools for visualizing data.
Moving beyond just exploring, the project applies statistical and machine learning methods to
uncover potential connections among different factors. This exploration seeks to understand the
complex relationships between risk elements, demographic information, and the occurrences of
diseases, to reveal underlying trends.

Identifying risk elements is a critical part, of assessing their importance in the beginning and
progression of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Making sure information from various sources
fits together and is consistent is crucial for this project. It uses thorough methods to clean and
prepare data, making the overall dataset better for stronger analysis.

Wrapping up, the project creates visualizations and reports to share findings effectively with both
technical and non-technical audiences. These tools offer useful insights into connections,
correlations, and trends found within the datasets of these diseases. This thorough approach helps
in understanding the complex factors contributing to these significant health issues. </p> 

# METHODOLOGY

To explore the potential interconnections between the datasets of heart disease, cancer, and
diabetes, a multi-phased approach was adopted. The methodology involved a combination of
statistical analysis, and data visualization to delve into the relationships and correlations among
these diseases.

# DATA COLLECTION & PREPROCESSING

The initial phase involved gathering datasets related to heart disease, cancer, and diabetes from
reputable sources. Each dataset underwent a meticulous cleaning process to ensure accuracy and
reliability. This included addressing missing values, handling outliers, and standardizing data
formats across all three datasets.

Data has been collected from various sources on the web including the following sites:
CDC.gov
Data.gov
US Dept of Health and Human Services
UCI Repository
Cancer.gov

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Cleaning of datasets included handling missing values, and outliers. We checked the dataset for
missing values. These might appear as blank cells, NaNs, or placeholders.
Upon completing the analysis, the focus shifted to interpreting the findings. Patterns of
correlations between specific risk factors, demographic overlaps among affected individuals, and
instances of coexisting conditions were carefully identified and analyzed. This phase aimed to
draw meaningful conclusions from the data exploration process.
This methodology was designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential
interconnections between heart disease, cancer, and diabetes datasets. By employing a systematic
approach that combined statistical analysis, and visualization tools like Tableau, pandas,
matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project aimed to uncover valuable insights into the relationships
among these diseases.

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

In the context of our project exploring the interconnections between heart disease, cancer, and
diabetes datasets, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the detective work we do at the beginning
to understand these datasets thoroughly.
Understanding the Data: We begin by diving into each dataset individually. We look at what
information they hold – patient details, medical records, diagnostic factors, or treatment
specifics. For instance, in the heart disease dataset, we might have information on cholesterol
levels, blood pressure, and previous medical history.
Summarizing the Data: Once we know what's in each dataset, we summarise the data. We
calculate statistics like averages, standard deviations, and ranges for numerical data. For
instance, we'd find the average age of patients, the most common blood sugar level, or the typical
tumour size.

Visualizing the Data: This part involves creating visual representations to understand the data
better. We use graphs, charts, and plots to see trends or patterns. We might create bar graphs to
compare the prevalence of certain diseases across different age groups or line graphs to observe
changes in disease occurrences over time.

Spotting Outliers or Anomalies: Sometimes, there might be unusual or extreme values that don’t
fit the usual pattern. We look for these outliers as they could significantly impact our analysis.
For instance, unusually high cholesterol levels or an abnormally young patient with a specific
disease might need closer examination.

Data Quality Check: Throughout this process, we ensure the data is reliable. We handle missing
values, correct inconsistencies, and make sure the data is clean and ready for further analysis.

# CORRELATION ANALYSIS

Analyzing correlations helps us find statistical connections between different things. For
instance, in our project, we're checking if high blood sugar levels (from the diabetes data) relate
to heart disease or specific cancers.

Correlation analysis shows how strong and in which direction these connections go. If it's a
positive correlation, it means when one thing goes up, the other tends to go up too (and vice
versa). If it's negative, when one goes up, the other tends to go down.

We used heatmaps to show these relationships visually. In our project, using data from diabetes
and cancer sets, the heatmap highlights which factors are closely linked. It's a quick way to spot
connections between diseases or shared risk factors.

By checking links between patient details, medical data, or lifestyle info across these sets, we
aim to find connections. For example, a strong link between obesity rates (in the diabetes data)
and heart disease could signal a shared risk.

Understanding these connections helps us see shared risk factors, how diseases show up, or
where affected groups overlap. It's key to seeing where these diseases might come together or
have common paths.

So, in this project, correlation analysis is a big help. It uncovers possible links between things in
the heart disease, cancer, and diabetes data. This gives us clues about how these diseases might
connect or share common factors.

# CONCLUSION:

The connections between cancer, heart disease, and diabetes are intricate and varied. Here are
some key links and shared aspects among these diseases:

Common Risk Factors:
1. Obesity: Being overweight is a shared risk for heart disease, specific cancers (like breast,
colon, and pancreatic cancers), and type 2 diabetes.
2. Age: The likelihood of all three diseases generally goes up as people get older.
3. Lifestyle: Unhealthy habits such as smoking and bad eating choices raise the risk of
cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.
4. Metabolic syndrome: Conditions like belly fat, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and
abnormal cholesterol levels. These link to a higher risk for heart disease, diabetes, and
some cancers.

This project wants to show what these diseases share and how they're different. It gives helpful
info for doctors, people who make rules, and researchers. The pictures and reports it makes help
everyone understand these tricky topics better, helping to make smarter choices. These tools help
everyone, no matter if they're experts or not, understand what's going on.
