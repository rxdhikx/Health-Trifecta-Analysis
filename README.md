# Introduction

Heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are chosen for discussion because they're significant and
constitute a widespread issue in the US. Heart disease is a major cause of death, putting a huge
burden on people and the healthcare system. Cancer, the second biggest killer, needs lots of
medical attention and costs a lot. Diabetes affects millions and strains healthcare resources,
leading to complications and making life tough for those affected.

These diseases not only take lives but also make life worse for those who have them. Solving
these issues needs a lot of things. We need to get people to live healthier, make sure they can get
preventive care easily, and keep finding new ways to treat these diseases. Research and new
ideas are key to understanding these diseases and making better treatments. To fight these
problems, everyone—doctors, leaders, researchers, and the community—needs to work together.

The project dives deep into data about these diseases. It looks at things like obesity, how the
body handles insulin, ongoing inflammation, lifestyle choices, and genetics to find out what's the
same about these conditions. By using statistical measures and tools to see data in pictures, we'll
figure out how all these things are connected—like how lifestyle choices and genes affect
inflammation and what that means for these diseases.

We'll use lots of different kinds of data, like medical records, factors causing it, geographical
data and surveys about how people live. By really digging into this data and showing it in clear
ways, we want to understand how these diseases all fit together. This will help make plans for
public health and ways to give personalized care.
